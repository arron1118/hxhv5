We offer sending newsletters of Your offers via contact forms to the sites of companies via all countries and domain zones of the world in any languages.  
 
https://xn----7sbb1bbndheurc1a.xn--p1ai/ 
 
WHAT IS THE MAILING OF INTERNET RESOURCES BY CONTACT FORMS? 
This is a type of mailing using the feedback forms that are located in the contact section of the website and filled by our programme automatically with a rate of a few thousand feedback forms per 1 minute, while the alphanumeric code from the pictures (captcha) is also solved. 
After that, the messages including your cooperation offers are sent to the emails of businesses. 
When sending mailing by contact contact forms, it turns out that each site sends an e-mail to its own e-mail and, therefore, all e-mails arrive in the inbox folder of the exact mailbox in which the organisation receives the correspondent emails. 
 
Unique Trade Offer: 
Fast one hundred percent notification of firms and site owners about new business offers. 
Search of new customers that other types of advertisements cannot find. 
 
AIM: 
Finding new customers that cannot be found through other advertisements. 
 
Benefits: 
1.100-percent delivery of commercial messages. 
2.Increase of the customer base. 
3. Expansion of the market segment. 
4.Mailings based on regionality and topics. 
5. Sending offers to company officials. 
6. Supply/demand analysis. 
7. Conducting marketing campaigns. 
8. Studying public opinion and conducting surveys. 
9. Notification speed. 
10. Price. 
11. Entering the international markets. 
 
Our competitive advantages: 
 
1.When sending mailing by contact forms, all messages arrive in the inbox. When sending mass e-mails, this can reach up to 5 percent. 
 
2.When sending mailing by feedback forms it is possible to send a few million messages per day to inboxes. When sending mass e-mails a few thousands arrive in the inboxes, all the remaining ones often either do not reach or fill the spam folder. 
 
3. When sending mailing by contact forms an e-mail does not get blocked by mails because it is sent from different sites. When sending bulk e-mails it is possible to send a few thousands of those but nevertheless all the IP addresses from which the mailing is sent will be blocked. 
 
4. When sending mailing by contact forms the minimum number of macro-synonims is used to form headings and text of the letter. When sending e-newsletters, it is necessary to use synonyms («macros») for each phrase and create ten thousand different headings. 
 
5. A lot of firms deliberatelly hide their mailbox and only leave a contact form for contacting with them. 
 
6. When sending mass e-mails, your business offer is delivered to every employee of the firm, (which causes discontent) compared to mailing by feedback forms where the message is received at the e-mail address specifically set up for commercial offers. 
 
7.Fifty % of business emails are located on free e-mail servers, they are poorly &quot;searchable&quot; by mailbox, but when sending mailing by contact forms through these mail systems, all messages are 100% delivered to the recipients. 
 
8. Only thirty-forty percent of companies get into the directories within several years, and all the other ones are already located in our WHOIS databases and are waiting for your cooperation  offers. 
Thus that mailboxes of firms from directories are full of spam, and therefore they will not have such profit as when sending mailing by contact forms using our always new VOIS databases. 
 
9. Any kind of stop words in the headings or body of the message can be sent through feedback forms. When sending mass e-mails, such letters either do not reach the recipient or end up in a spam folder. 
The list of stop words of mails includes almost all words and phrases that encourage potential customers to take active actions.

3. Reaching out company officials.

When sending mailing by contact forms, you will will be absolutely sure that your message has been delivered to one hundred percent of consumers of your service and product and if a product or service is &quot;badly promoted&quot;, then the potential problem lies in other things, for example in price. 
At the same time, within one week you will see real demand for your products and services, you will not need to spend funds on renting premises and other more expensive and time-consuming marketing activities. 
 
3.Mailing by contact forms is the most economical and quickest way to get your product or service to the markets of other states.

6. Full geographical scope for all countries of the globe. 
 
7. We offer customers that you will not find through other types of advertisement. 
When sending mailing by feedback forms, you will be able to reach out that part of your potential clients, that are impossible to find in automatic mode in another way. 
For instance, you will be able to deliver a cooperation offer to those potential clients that were previously out of reach due to filters of mail systems while sending e-mail newsletters. 
Now, there is a very unusual situation: firms in the directories are completely filled with spam with all sorts of cooperation offers while very little or no e-mails are sent to the remaining ones. 
 
8. Unique technology of unraveling the captcha. 
There are special services for decoding alphanumeric code (captcha/CAPTCHA). It costs a dollar to solve 1000  CAPTCHAs.

11. The base of countries also includes all joint companies from all over the world closely related to or working with this country, for instance, national communities and diasporas. 
Sanctions of mail systems and search engines? 
These mailings are an alternative to sending mass e-mails, therefore search engine sanctions and &quot;BAN&quot; do not apply to them. 
The mail system delivers the data of letters to the inbox folder, as it passes through the &quot;warm communication channel&quot; from the new IP address of the site to the corporate e-mail address of the same internet resource. 
In simple language, these mailings &quot;live in emails&quot; and e-mail filters do not react to them, because mail systems have great trust in communication channels between internet resources and corporate emails.
